# Updated_Flat_norm
I made a new GitHub repository because I couldn't figure out how to work GitHub's pull requests without being the creator of the repository and figured it might be easier to seperate all the code in a new spot anyways. 

Updated code with Curtis Summer 2023

Tests have been built for random sample, graph and f classes in 2D and 3D.

Still need:
Tests for Edmond Karp Class, 
Tests for Messing with mincut, 
Tests for Voronoi class in 2D and 3D
