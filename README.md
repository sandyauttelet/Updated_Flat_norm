# Updated_Flat_norm

Updated code with Curtis Summer 2023

Tests have been built for random sample, graph and f classes in 2D and 3D.

Still need:
Tests for Edmond Karp Class, 
Tests for Messing with mincut, 
Tests for Voronoi class in 2D and 3D

This repository was eventually abandonded and replaced by flat_norm_on_graphs as we rebuilt much of what exists here. This repository contains my reinvention of many wheels existing within Python packages such as NetworkX.
